    # Directory Objects

    This API offers the ability to interact with some of our core features; otherwise known as Directory Objects. The Directory Objects are:

    * Commands
    * Policies
    * Policy Groups
    * Applications
    * Systems
    * Users
    * User Groups
    * System Groups
    * Radius Servers
    * Directories: Office 365, LDAP,G-Suite, Active Directory
    * Duo accounts and applications.

    The Directory Object is an important concept to understand in order to successfully use JumpCloud API.

    ## JumpCloud Graph

    We've also introduced the concept of the JumpCloud Graph along with  Directory Objects. The Graph is a powerful aspect of our platform which will enable you to associate objects with each other, or establish membership for certain objects to become members of other objects.

    Specific `GET` endpoints will allow you to traverse the JumpCloud Graph to return all indirect and directly bound objects in your organization.

    # API Key

    ## Access Your API Key

    To locate your API Key:

    1. Log into the [JumpCloud Admin Console](https://console.jumpcloud.com/).
    2. Go to the username drop down located in the top-right of the Console.
    3. Retrieve your API key from API Settings.

    ## API Key Considerations

    This API key is associated to the currently logged in administrator. Other admins will have different API keys.

    **WARNING** Please keep this API key secret, as it grants full access to any data accessible via your JumpCloud console account.

    You can also reset your API key in the same location in the JumpCloud Admin Console.

    ## Recycling or Resetting Your API Key

    In order to revoke access with the current API key, simply reset your API key. This will render all calls using the previous API key inaccessible.

    Your API key will be passed in as a header with the header name "x-api-key".

    ```bash
    curl -H "x-api-key: [YOUR_API_KEY_HERE]" "https://console.jumpcloud.com/api/v2/systemgroups"
    ```

    ## Introduction

    JumpCloud System Context Authorization is an alternative way to authenticate with a subset of JumpCloud's REST APIs. Using this method, a system can manage its information and resource associations, allowing modern auto provisioning environments to scale as needed.

    **Notes:**

     * The following documentation applies to Linux Operating Systems only.
     * Systems that have been automatically enrolled using Apple's Device Enrollment Program (DEP) or systems enrolled using the User Portal install are not eligible to use the System Context API to prevent unauthorized access to system groups and resources. If a script that utilizes the System Context API is invoked on a system enrolled in this way, it will display an error.

    ## Supported Endpoints

    JumpCloud System Context Authorization can be used in conjunction with Systems endpoints found in the V1 API and certain System Group endpoints found in the v2 API.

    * A system may fetch, alter, and delete metadata about itself, including manipulating a system's Group and Systemuser associations,
      * `/api/systems/{system_id}` | [`GET`](https://docs.jumpcloud.com/api/1.0/index.html#operation/systems_get) [`PUT`](https://docs.jumpcloud.com/api/1.0/index.html#operation/systems_put)
    * A system may delete itself from your JumpCloud organization
      * `/api/systems/{system_id}` | [`DELETE`](https://docs.jumpcloud.com/api/1.0/index.html#operation/systems_delete)
    * A system may fetch its direct resource associations under v2 (Groups)
      * `/api/v2/systems/{system_id}/memberof` | [`GET`](https://docs.jumpcloud.com/api/2.0/index.html#operation/graph_systemGroupMembership)
      * `/api/v2/systems/{system_id}/associations` | [`GET`](https://docs.jumpcloud.com/api/2.0/index.html#operation/graph_systemAssociationsList)
      * `/api/v2/systems/{system_id}/users` | [`GET`](https://docs.jumpcloud.com/api/2.0/index.html#operation/graph_systemTraverseUser)
    * A system may alter its direct resource associations under v2 (Groups)
      * `/api/v2/systems/{system_id}/associations` | [`POST`](https://docs.jumpcloud.com/api/2.0/index.html#operation/graph_systemAssociationsPost)
    * A system may alter its System Group associations
      * `/api/v2/systemgroups/{group_id}/members` | [`POST`](https://docs.jumpcloud.com/api/2.0/index.html#operation/graph_systemGroupMembersPost)
        * _NOTE_ If a system attempts to alter the system group membership of a different system the request will be rejected

    ## Response Codes

    If endpoints other than those described above are called using the System Context API, the server will return a `401` response.

    ## Authentication

    To allow for secure access to our APIs, you must authenticate each API request.
    JumpCloud System Context Authorization uses [HTTP Signatures](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-cavage-http-signatures-00) to authenticate API requests.
    The HTTP Signatures sent with each request are similar to the signatures used by the Amazon Web Services REST API.
    To help with the request-signing process, we have provided an [example bash script](https://github.com/TheJumpCloud/SystemContextAPI/blob/master/examples/shell/SigningExample.sh). This example API request simply requests the entire system record. You must be root, or have permissions to access the contents of the `/opt/jc` directory to generate a signature.

    Here is a breakdown of the example script with explanations.

    First, the script extracts the systemKey from the JSON formatted `/opt/jc/jcagent.conf` file.

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    conf="`cat /opt/jc/jcagent.conf`"
    regex="systemKey\":\"(\w+)\""

    if [[ $conf =~ $regex ]] ; then
      systemKey="${BASH_REMATCH[1]}"
    fi
    ```

    Then, the script retrieves the current date in the correct format.

    ```bash
    now=`date -u "+%a, %d %h %Y %H:%M:%S GMT"`;
    ```

    Next, we build a signing string to demonstrate the expected signature format. The signed string must consist of the [request-line](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#page-35) and the date header, separated by a newline character.

    ```bash
    signstr="GET /api/systems/${systemKey} HTTP/1.1\ndate: ${now}"
    ```

    The next step is to calculate and apply the signature. This is a two-step process:

    1. Create a signature from the signing string using the JumpCloud Agent private key: ``printf "$signstr" | openssl dgst -sha256 -sign /opt/jc/client.key``
    2. Then Base64-encode the signature string and trim off the newline characters: ``| openssl enc -e -a | tr -d '\n'``

    The combined steps above result in:

    ```bash
    signature=`printf "$signstr" | openssl dgst -sha256 -sign /opt/jc/client.key | openssl enc -e -a | tr -d '\n'` ;
    ```

    Finally, we make sure the API call sending the signature has the same Authorization and Date header values, HTTP method, and URL that were used in the signing string.

    ```bash
    curl -iq \
      -H "Accept: application/json" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -H "Date: ${now}" \
      -H "Authorization: Signature keyId=\"system/${systemKey}\",headers=\"request-line date\",algorithm=\"rsa-sha256\",signature=\"${signature}\"" \
      --url https://console.jumpcloud.com/api/systems/${systemKey}
    ```

    ### Input Data

    All PUT and POST methods should use the HTTP Content-Type header with a value of 'application/json'. PUT methods are used for updating a record. POST methods are used to create a record.

    The following example demonstrates how to update the `displayName` of the system.

    ```bash
    signstr="PUT /api/systems/${systemKey} HTTP/1.1\ndate: ${now}"
    signature=`printf "$signstr" | openssl dgst -sha256 -sign /opt/jc/client.key | openssl enc -e -a | tr -d '\n'` ;

    curl -iq \
      -d "{\"displayName\" : \"updated-system-name-1\"}" \
      -X "PUT" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -H "Accept: application/json" \
      -H "Date: ${now}" \
      -H "Authorization: Signature keyId=\"system/${systemKey}\",headers=\"request-line date\",algorithm=\"rsa-sha256\",signature=\"${signature}\"" \
      --url https://console.jumpcloud.com/api/systems/${systemKey}
    ```

    ### Output Data

    All results will be formatted as JSON.

    Here is an abbreviated example of response output:

    ```json
    {
      "_id": "625ee96f52e144993e000015",
      "agentServer": "lappy386",
      "agentVersion": "0.9.42",
      "arch": "x86_64",
      "connectionKey": "127.0.0.1_51812",
      "displayName": "ubuntu-1204",
      "firstContact": "2013-10-16T19:30:55.611Z",
      "hostname": "ubuntu-1204"
      ...
    ```

    ## Additional Examples

    ### Signing Authentication Example

    This example demonstrates how to make an authenticated request to fetch the JumpCloud record for this system.

    [SigningExample.sh](https://github.com/TheJumpCloud/SystemContextAPI/blob/master/examples/shell/SigningExample.sh)

    ### Shutdown Hook

    This example demonstrates how to make an authenticated request on system shutdown.
    Using an init.d script registered at run level 0, you can call the System Context API as the system is shutting down.

    [Instance-shutdown-initd](https://github.com/TheJumpCloud/SystemContextAPI/blob/master/examples/instance-shutdown-initd) is an example of an init.d script that only runs at system shutdown.

    After customizing the [instance-shutdown-initd](https://github.com/TheJumpCloud/SystemContextAPI/blob/master/examples/instance-shutdown-initd) script, you should install it on the system(s) running the JumpCloud agent.

    1. Copy the modified [instance-shutdown-initd](https://github.com/TheJumpCloud/SystemContextAPI/blob/master/examples/instance-shutdown-initd) to `/etc/init.d/instance-shutdown`.
    2. On Ubuntu systems, run `update-rc.d instance-shutdown defaults`. On RedHat/CentOS systems, run `chkconfig --add instance-shutdown`.

    # Multi-Tenant Portal Headers

    Multi-Tenant Organization API Headers are available for JumpCloud Admins to use when making API requests from Organizations that have multiple managed organizations.

    The `x-org-id` is a required header for all multi-tenant admins when making API requests to JumpCloud. This header will define to which organization you would like to make the request.

    **NOTE** Single Tenant Admins do not need to provide this header when making an API request.

    ## Header Value

    `x-org-id`

    ## API Response Codes

    * `400` Malformed ID.
    * `400` x-org-id and Organization path ID do not match.
    * `401` ID not included for multi-tenant admin
    * `403` ID included on unsupported route.
    * `404` Organization ID Not Found.

    ```bash
    curl -X GET https://console.jumpcloud.com/api/v2/directories \
      -H 'accept: application/json' \
      -H 'content-type: application/json' \
      -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
      -H 'x-org-id: {ORG_ID}'

    ```

    ## To Obtain an Individual Organization ID via the UI

    As a prerequisite, your Primary Organization will need to be setup for Multi-Tenancy. This provides access to the Multi-Tenant Organization Admin Portal.

    1. Log into JumpCloud [Admin Console](https://console.jumpcloud.com). If you are a multi-tenant Admin, you will automatically be routed to the Multi-Tenant Admin Portal.
    2. From the Multi-Tenant Portal's primary navigation bar, select the Organization you'd like to access.
    3. You will automatically be routed to that Organization's Admin Console.
    4. Go to Settings in the sub-tenant's primary navigation.
    5. You can obtain your Organization ID below your Organization's Contact Information on the Settings page.

    ## To Obtain All Organization IDs via the API

    * You can make an API request to this endpoint using the API key of your Primary Organization.  `https://console.jumpcloud.com/api/organizations/` This will return all your managed organizations.

    ```bash
    curl -X GET \
      https://console.jumpcloud.com/api/organizations/ \
      -H 'Accept: application/json' \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}'
    ```

        This endpoint will return all Users Groups bound to an Active Directory instance, either directly or indirectly, essentially traversing the JumpCloud Graph for your Organization.

        Each element will contain the group's type, id, attributes and paths.

        The `attributes` object is a key/value hash of compiled graph attributes for all paths followed.

        The `paths` array enumerates each path from this Active Directory instance to the corresponding User Group; this array represents all grouping and/or associations that would have to be removed to deprovision the User Group from this Active Directory instance.

        See `/members` and `/associations` endpoints to manage those collections.

        This endpoint will return all Users bound to an Active Directory instance, either directly or indirectly, essentially traversing the JumpCloud Graph for your Organization.

        Each element will contain the type, id, attributes and paths.

        The `attributes` object is a key/value hash of compiled graph attributes for all paths followed.

        The `paths` array enumerates each path from this Active Directory instance to the corresponding User; this array represents all grouping and/or associations that would have to be removed to deprovision the User from this Active Directory instance.

        See `/members` and `/associations` endpoints to manage those collections.

        #### Sample Request
        ```
        curl -X GET https://console.jumpcloud.com/api/v2/activedirectories/{ActiveDirectory_ID}/users \
          -H 'accept: application/json' \
          -H 'content-type: application/json' \

        This endpoint allows you to create a user import job that will import new users and/or update existing users in JumpCloud from the application.  The endpoint can currently only be used for applications that have an active Identity Management custom API integration.  The request will  fail with a “Not found” error for applications if that type of integration is not configured.  To learn more about configuring this type of integration, read [Import users from an external identity source using a custom API integration](https://support.jumpcloud.com/support/s/article/Import-users-from-a-custom-rest-API-integration).

        The endpoint allows you to create a bulk job to asynchronously create users.
        See [Create a System User](https://docs.jumpcloud.com/api/1.0/index.html#operation/systemusers_post)
        for the full list of attributes.

        #### Default User State
        The `state` of each user in the request can be explicitly passed in or
        omitted. If `state` is omitted, then the user will get created
        using the value returned from the
        [Get an Organization](https://docs.jumpcloud.com/api/1.0/index.html#operation/organizations_get)
        endpoint. The default user state for bulk created users depends on the
        `creation-source` header. For `creation-source:jumpcloud:bulk` the
        default state is stored in `settings.newSystemUserStateDefaults.csvImport`.
        For other `creation-source` header values, the default state is stored in
        `settings.newSystemUserStateDefaults.applicationImport`

        These default state values can be changed in the admin portal settings
        or by using the
        [Update an Organization](https://docs.jumpcloud.com/api/1.0/index.html#operation/organization_put)
        endpoint.

        This endpoint is used to lookup the next upcoming scheduled state change for each user in the
        given list. The users parameter is limited to 100 items per request. The results are also limited
        to 100 items. This endpoint returns a max of 1 event per state per user. For example, if a user
        has 3 ACTIVATED events scheduled it will return the next upcoming activation event. However, if a
        user also has a SUSPENDED event scheduled along with the ACTIVATED events it will return the next
        upcoming activation event _and_ the next upcoming suspension event.

        This endpoint returns the _direct_ associations of this G Suite instance.

        A direct association can be a non-homogeneous relationship between 2 different objects, for example G Suite and Users.


        #### Sample Request
        ```
        curl -X POST https://console.jumpcloud.com/api/v2/gsuites/{Gsuite_ID}/associations \
          -H 'accept: application/json' \
          -H 'content-type: application/json' \

        This endpoint will return all User Groups bound to an G Suite instance, either directly or indirectly, essentially traversing the JumpCloud Graph for your Organization.

        Each element will contain the group's type, id, attributes and paths.

        The `attributes` object is a key/value hash of compiled graph attributes for all paths followed.

        The `paths` array enumerates each path from this G Suite instance to the corresponding User Group; this array represents all grouping and/or associations that would have to be removed to deprovision the User Group from this G Suite instance.

        See `/members` and `/associations` endpoints to manage those collections.

        A direct association can be a non-homogeneous relationship between 2 different objects, for example a Routing Policy and Users.

        #### Sample Request
        ```
        curl -X GET https://console.jumpcloud.com/api/v2/identity-provider/policies/{IDP_ROUTING_POLICY_ID}/associations?targets=user_group \

        This endpoint will return all Users Groups bound to a routing policy, either directly or indirectly, essentially traversing the JumpCloud Graph for your Organization.

        Each element will contain the group's type, id, attributes and paths.

        The `attributes` object is a key/value hash of compiled graph attributes for all paths followed.

        The `paths` array enumerates each path from this routing policy instance to the corresponding User Group; this array represents all grouping and/or associations that would have to be removed to deprovision the User Group from this routing policy.

        See `/members` and `/associations` endpoints to manage those collections.

        A direct association can be a non-homogeneous relationship between 2 different objects, for example LDAP and Users.

        #### Sample Request
        ```
        curl -X POST https://console.jumpcloud.com/api/v2/ldapservers/{LDAP_ID}/associations \
          -H 'Accept: application/json' \
          -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
          -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
          -d '{
            "op": "add",
            "type": "user",
            "id": "{User_ID}"
          }'

        This endpoint will return all Users Groups bound to a LDAP Server, either directly or indirectly, essentially traversing the JumpCloud Graph for your Organization.

        Each element will contain the group's type, id, attributes and paths.

        The `attributes` object is a key/value hash of compiled graph attributes for all paths followed.

        The `paths` array enumerates each path from this LDAP server instance to the corresponding User Group; this array represents all grouping and/or associations that would have to be removed to deprovision the User Group from this LDAP server instance.

        See `/members` and `/associations` endpoints to manage those collections.

        This endpoint will return all Systems Groups bound to a Policy, either directly or indirectly, essentially traversing the JumpCloud Graph for your Organization.

        Each element will contain the group's type, id, attributes and paths.

        The `attributes` object is a key/value hash of compiled graph attributes for all paths followed.

        The `paths` array enumerates each path from this Policy to the corresponding System Group; this array represents all grouping and/or associations that would have to be removed to deprovision the System Group from this Policy.

        See `/members` and `/associations` endpoints to manage those collections.

        This endpoint will return all Users Groups bound to a RADIUS Server, either directly or indirectly, essentially traversing the JumpCloud Graph for your Organization.

        Each element will contain the group's type, id, attributes and paths.

        The `attributes` object is a key/value hash of compiled graph attributes for all paths followed.

        The `paths` array enumerates each path from this RADIUS server instance to the corresponding User Group; this array represents all grouping and/or associations that would have to be removed to deprovision the User Group from this RADIUS server instance.

        See `/members` and `/associations` endpoints to manage those collections.

      description: |-
        This endpoint will return all Users bound to a RADIUS Server, either directly or indirectly, essentially traversing the JumpCloud Graph for your Organization.

        Each element will contain the type, id, attributes and paths.

        The `attributes` object is a key/value hash of compiled graph attributes for all paths followed.

        The `paths` array enumerates each path from this RADIUS server instance to the corresponding User; this array represents all grouping and/or associations that would have to be removed to deprovision the User from this RADIUS server instance.

        See `/members` and `/associations` endpoints to manage those collections.

        This endpoint allows you to manage the _direct_ associations of a System Group.

        A direct association can be a non-homogeneous relationship between 2 different objects, for example System Groups and Users.


        #### Sample Request

        This endpoint will return all Commands bound to a System Group, either directly or indirectly, essentially traversing the JumpCloud Graph for your Organization.

        Each element will contain the group's type, id, attributes and paths.

        The `attributes` object is a key/value hash of compiled graph attributes for all paths followed.

        The `paths` array enumerates each path from this System Group to the corresponding Command; this array represents all grouping and/or associations that would have to be removed to deprovision the Command from this System Group.

        See `/members` and `/associations` endpoints to manage those collections.

        ```

        This endpoint will return all Policies bound to a System Group, either directly or indirectly, essentially traversing the JumpCloud Graph for your Organization.

        Each element will contain the type, id, attributes and paths.

        The `attributes` object is a key/value hash of compiled graph attributes for all paths followed.

        The `paths` array enumerates each path from this System Group to the corresponding Policy; this array represents all grouping and/or associations that would have to be removed to deprovision the Policy from this System Group.

        See `/members` and `/associations` endpoints to manage those collections.

        This endpoint is not public yet as we haven't finished the code.

        This endpoint will return all User Groups bound to a System Group, either directly or indirectly, essentially traversing the JumpCloud Graph for your Organization.

        Each element will contain the type, id, attributes and paths.

        The `attributes` object is a key/value hash of compiled graph attributes for all paths followed.

        The `paths` array enumerates each path from this System Group to the corresponding User Group; this array represents all grouping and/or associations that would have to be removed to deprovision the User Group from this System Group.

        See `/members` and `/associations` endpoints to manage those collections.

        #### Sample Request
        ```
        curl -X GET https://console.jumpcloud.com/api/v2/systemgroups/{GroupID}/usergroups \

        This endpoint will return all Commands bound to a System, either directly or indirectly, essentially traversing the JumpCloud Graph for your Organization.

        Each element will contain the type, id, attributes and paths.

        The `attributes` object is a key/value hash of compiled graph attributes for all paths followed.

        The `paths` array enumerates each path from this System to the corresponding Command; this array represents all grouping and/or associations that would have to be removed to deprovision the Command from this System.

        See `/members` and `/associations` endpoints to manage those collections.

        This endpoint will return all User Groups bound to a System, either directly or indirectly essentially traversing the JumpCloud Graph for your Organization.

        Each element will contain the type, id, attributes and paths.

        The `attributes` object is a key/value hash of compiled graph attributes for all paths followed.

        The `paths` array enumerates each path from this System to the corresponding User Group; this array represents all grouping and/or associations that would have to be removed to deprovision the User Group from this System.

        See `/members` and `/associations` endpoints to manage those collections.

        This endpoint will return all Users bound to a System, either directly or indirectly essentially traversing the JumpCloud Graph for your Organization.

        Each element will contain the type, id, attributes and paths.

        The `attributes` object is a key/value hash of compiled graph attributes for all paths followed.

        The `paths` array enumerates each path from this System to the corresponding User; this array represents all grouping and/or associations that would have to be removed to deprovision the User from this System.

        See `/members` and `/associations` endpoints to manage those collections.

        #### Sample Request
        ```
        curl -X GET https://console.jumpcloud.com/api/v2/systems/{System_ID}/users \
          -H 'Accept: application/json' \
          -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
          -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}'

        This endpoint will return all Active Directory Instances bound to a User Group, either directly or indirectly, essentially traversing the JumpCloud Graph for your Organization.

        The `attributes` object is a key/value hash of compiled graph attributes for all paths followed.

        The `paths` array enumerates each path from this User Group to the corresponding Active Directory; this array represents all grouping and/or associations that would have to be removed to deprovision the Active Directory from this User Group.

        See `/members` and `/associations` endpoints to manage those collections.

        This endpoint will return all G Suite Instances bound to a User Group, either directly or indirectly, essentially traversing the JumpCloud Graph for your Organization.

        Each element will contain the type, id, attributes and paths

        The `attributes` object is a key/value hash of compiled graph attributes for all paths followed.

        The `paths` array enumerates each path from this User Group to the corresponding G Suite instance; this array represents all grouping and/or associations that would have to be removed to deprovision the G Suite instance from this User Group.

        See `/members` and `/associations` endpoints to manage those collections.

        This endpoint will return all System Groups bound to a User Group, either directly or indirectly, essentially traversing the JumpCloud Graph for your Organization.

        Each element will contain the type, id, attributes and paths.

        The `attributes` object is a key/value hash of compiled graph attributes for all paths followed.

        The `paths` array enumerates each path from this User Group to the corresponding System Group; this array represents all grouping and/or associations that would have to be removed to deprovision the System Group from this User Group.

        See `/members` and `/associations` endpoints to manage those collections.

        This endpoint will return all LDAP Servers bound to a User, either directly or indirectly, essentially traversing the JumpCloud Graph for your Organization.

        Each element will contain the type, id, attributes and paths.

        The `attributes` object is a key/value hash of compiled graph attributes for all paths followed.

        The `paths` array enumerates each path from this User to the corresponding LDAP Server; this array represents all grouping and/or associations that would have to be removed to deprovision the LDAP Server from this User.

        See `/members` and `/associations` endpoints to manage those collections.

        This endpoint will return all RADIUS Servers bound to a User, either directly or indirectly, essentially traversing the JumpCloud Graph for your Organization.

        Each element will contain the type, id, attributes and paths.

        The `attributes` object is a key/value hash of compiled graph attributes for all paths followed.

        The `paths` array enumerates each path from this User to the corresponding RADIUS Server; this array represents all grouping and/or associations that would have to be removed to deprovision the RADIUS Server from this User.

        See `/members` and `/associations` endpoints to manage those collections.

        #### Sample Request
        ```
        curl -X GET https://console.jumpcloud.com/api/v2/users/{UserID}/radiusservers \
          -H 'Accept: application/json' \

        This endpoint will return all System Groups bound to a User, either directly or indirectly, essentially traversing the JumpCloud Graph for your Organization.

        This endpoint allows you to create a new workday instance.

        You must supply a username and password for `Basic Authentication` that is the same as your WorkDay Integrator System User.  Failure to provide these credentials  will result in the request being rejected.

        Currently `O-Auth` isn't a supported authentication protocol for WorkDay, but will be in the future.

        Currently, only one instance is allowed and it must be `Workday Import`.

            Conditions may be added to an authentication policy using the following conditional language:

            ```
            <conditions> ::= <expression>
            <expression> ::= <deviceEncrypted> | <deviceManaged> | <ipAddressIn> |
                             <locationIn> | <notExpression> | <allExpression> |
                             <anyExpression>
            <deviceEncrypted> ::= { "deviceEncrypted": <boolean> }
            <deviceManaged> ::= { "deviceManaged": <boolean> }
            <ipAddressIn> ::= { "ipAddressIn": [ <objectId>, ... ] }
            <locationIn> ::= { "locationIn": {
                                 "countries": [
                                   <iso_3166_country_code>, ...
                                 ]
                               }
                             }
            <notExpression> ::= { "not": <expression> }
            <allExpression> ::= { "all": [ <expression>, ... ] }
            <anyExpression> ::= { "any": [ <expression>, ... ] }
            ```

            For example, to add a condition that applies to IP addresses in a given list, the following condition can be added:

            ```
            {"ipAddressIn": [ <ip_list_object_id> ]}
            ```

            If you would rather exclude IP addresses in the given lists, the following condition could be added:

            ```
            {
              "not": {
                "ipAddressIn": [ <ip_list_object_id_1>, <ip_list_object_id_2> ]
              }
            }
            ```

            You may also include more than one condition and choose whether "all" or "any" of them must be met for the policy to apply:

            ```
            {
              "all": [
                {
                  "ipAddressIn": [ <ip_list_object_id>, ... ]
                },
                {
                  "deviceManaged": true
                },
                {
                  "locationIn": {
                    countries: [ <iso_3166_country_code>, ... ]
                  }
                }
              ]

            Conditions may be added to an authentication policy using the following conditional language:

            <expression> ::= <deviceEncrypted> | <deviceManaged> | <ipAddressIn> |
                             <locationIn> | <notExpression> | <allExpression> |
                             <anyExpression>
            <deviceEncrypted> ::= { "deviceEncrypted": <boolean> }
            <deviceManaged> ::= { "deviceManaged": <boolean> }
            <ipAddressIn> ::= { "ipAddressIn": [ <objectId>, ... ] }
            <locationIn> ::= { "locationIn": {
                                 "countries": [
                                   <iso_3166_country_code>, ...

                               }
                             }
            <notExpression> ::= { "not": <expression> }
            <allExpression> ::= { "all": [ <expression>, ... ] }
            <anyExpression> ::= { "any": [ <expression>, ... ] }
            ```

            For example, to add a condition that applies to IP addresses in a given list, the following condition can be added:

            ```
            {"ipAddressIn": [ <ip_list_object_id> ]}
            ```

            If you would rather exclude IP addresses in the given lists, the following condition could be added:

            ```
            {
              "not": {
                "ipAddressIn": [ <ip_list_object_id_1>, <ip_list_object_id_2> ]
              }
            }
            ```

            You may also include more than one condition and choose whether "all" or "any" of them must be met for the policy to apply:

            ```
            {
              "all": [
                {

                {
                  "deviceManaged": true
                },
                {
                  "locationIn": {

                                 "countries": [
                                   <iso_3166_country_code>, ...
                                 ]

            <anyExpression> ::= { "any": [ <expression>, ... ] }
            ```

            For example, to add a condition that applies to IP addresses in a given list, the following condition can be added:

            ```
            {"ipAddressIn": [ <ip_list_object_id> ]}
            ```

            If you would rather exclude IP addresses in the given lists, the following condition could be added:

            ```
            {
              "not": {
                "ipAddressIn": [ <ip_list_object_id_1>, <ip_list_object_id_2> ]
              }
            }
            ```

            You may also include more than one condition and choose whether "all" or "any" of them must be met for the policy to apply:

            ```
            {
              "all": [
                {
                  "ipAddressIn": [ <ip_list_object_id>, ... ]
                },
                {
                  "deviceManaged": true
                },
                {
                  "locationIn": {
                    countries: [ <iso_3166_country_code>, ... ]
                  }
                }
              ]
            }
            ```
